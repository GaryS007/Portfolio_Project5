# Testing

* When building this site, I would test at every step of progress. Each function that was added in a view needed to be tested immediately before proceeding on with any additional functionality or coding. If anything went wrong, I would debug and find a solution before moving on.

### Python Validation - Pycodestyle
* I had an issue with my IDE linter. So all code was written manually which was great practice. When I ran Python Validation I had a lot of errors to fix but it was worth it. All Python files were reviews.
